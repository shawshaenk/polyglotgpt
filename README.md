## PolyglotGPT - Conversational AI for Learning 50+ Languages
**A multilingual AI chatbot for language learners, built with Gemini API + React**  

PolyglotGPT is an open-source platform designed to help people **practice speaking and learning new languages** without the cost or limitations of traditional apps. Unlike Duolingo or standard AI chatbots, PolyglotGPT focuses on **real conversational practice**, **on-demand translation**, **romanization**, and **authentic speech synthesis**.

## 🚀 Motivation  
Learning languages can be frustrating:  
- Textbook learning feels clinical and disconnected.  
- Apps like Duolingo don’t provide real practice.  
- Existing AI chatbots lack **quick translation**, **romanization**, and **universal speech support**.  

PolyglotGPT is my attempt to fix that, using AI as a free, accessible practice partner.
